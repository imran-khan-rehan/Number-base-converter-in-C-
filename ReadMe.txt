# Number Base Converter

The Number Base Converter is a simple Windows Forms application that allows users to convert numbers between different numerical bases, such as binary, denary (decimal), and hexadecimal. This README provides an overview of the application's features and how to use them.

## Features

- Convert numbers between binary, denary, and hexadecimal bases.
- Perform left and right shifts on binary numbers.
- Specify the number of bits for binary representation.
- Input numbers via keyboard or on-screen digit buttons.
- Validate input to ensure correctness of entered numbers.

## Components

### Radio Buttons

The application includes radio buttons to select the desired numerical base for input and conversion. Users can choose between Binary, Denary, and Hexadecimal.

### Input Fields

- **Binary**: Users can input binary numbers in this field. The application performs conversions to Denary and Hexadecimal.
- **Denary**: Users can input denary numbers in this field. The application performs conversions to Binary and Hexadecimal.
- **Hexadecimal**: Users can input hexadecimal numbers in this field. The application performs conversions to Denary and Binary.

### Shift Buttons

- **Left Shift**: Performs a left shift operation on the binary number entered in the Binary field.
- **Right Shift**: Performs a right shift operation on the binary number entered in the Binary field.

### Bits Count

Users can specify the number of bits for the binary representation by adjusting the value using the provided numeric up-down control.

### Digit Buttons

The application provides on-screen digit buttons from 0 to 9 to allow users to input numbers using the cursor instead of the keyboard.

### Conversion Logic

- When a number is entered or modified in any of the input fields, the application automatically performs conversions and updates the other fields accordingly.
- Input validation ensures that only valid numbers are accepted for conversion.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.
2. Choose the desired numerical base using the radio buttons.
3. Input numbers in the corresponding input field.
4. Optionally, perform left or right shifts on binary numbers using the shift buttons.
5. Adjust the number of bits for binary representation if necessary.
6. Use the digit buttons to input numbers via the cursor.
7. The application automatically updates the converted values in real-time.
